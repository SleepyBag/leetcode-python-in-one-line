* Leetcode in One Line with Python

I want to solve all the leetcode easy problems in one line with python. That's it.

** Restrictions
   - One line means "one expression", which means I'm not going to use ";" combining multiple lines into one.
   - "exec" and "eval" are allowed. However, ";" is not allowed to be used in their arguments.

If you have a solution better than mine, please feel free to report an issue, or start a PR.
