* Leetcode in One Line with Python

I want to solve all the leetcode easy problems in one line with python. That's it.

** Restrictions
   - One line means "one expression", which means I'm not going to use ";" combining multiple lines into one.
   - "exec" is not allowed so that I can't pack multiple expressions into an "exec" call.

If you have a solution better than mine, please feel free to report an issue, or start a PR.
